# Hobo Survival (Prototype)

A tiny top-down survival game about being cold, hungry, and extremely unlucky — but still stubborn enough to last 5 minutes.

You spawn in a sketchy neighborhood, walk around with **WASD**, grab random survival junk, and try not to become a frozen snack.  
**Day is manageable. Night is mean.** Shelters matter. Standing still is basically signing your own death certificate.

## Features
- Top-down free-roam map + camera follow
- Survival stats: **Health / Hunger / Warmth**
- **Day/Night cycle** (night drains warmth harder)
- **Shelters** that reduce warmth drain
- Simple inventory (9 slots) with clickable item use
- Random items on the ground (food, water, jacket, cardboard, medkit)
- Win condition: **survive 5 minutes**
- Lose condition: **health hits 0** (usually because hunger/warmth hit 0 first)

## Controls
- **W A S D** — move
- **Left Click** — pick up the nearest item (when close)
- **1–9** — use inventory slot
- **Mouse click on slot** — use item
- **P** — pause
